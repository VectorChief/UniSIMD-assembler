To build SIMD test framework on Linux, open terminal window,
go to UniSIMD's "test" folder,
make sure necessary tools and libraries are installed
for native builds (binary ABI matches host):
    sudo apt-get install make g++
for multilib builds (if libs are available):
    sudo apt-get install make g++-multilib
run for x86 architecture:
    make -f simd_make_x86.mk
    ./simd_test.x86
run for x64 architecture:
    make -f simd_make_x64.mk
    ./simd_test.x64f32
run for non-x86 architectures:
    make -f simd_make_***.mk
    ./simd_test.***
Prerequisites for building/emulating guest non-x86 architectures as well as
configurations for particular hardware platforms are given in the makefiles.
Only DEB-based distributions (Mint, Ubuntu, Debian) are supported for now,
users of RPM-based distributions need to figure out build-deps on their own.

To build SIMD test framework on Windows,
go to UniSIMD's "test" folder and open (in Visual C++ 6.0 or later):
    simd_workspace.dsw
In newer versions of VC++ agree to convert workspace files.
Exit and open newly created solution file for development.
Select "Release" build target in drop-down list/menus, then press F5.

To build SIMD test framework for 64-bit Windows,
download and install TDM64-GCC toolchain (tdm64-gcc-5.1.0-2.exe),
then open UniSIMD's "test" folder and run (from Windows UI):
    simd_make_w64.bat
produced simd_test_w64f32.exe binary file will launch upon build completion.

To build QEMU emulator from source on Linux, download the latest version from
    http://wiki.qemu.org/Download
and unpack the archive, open terminal window, go to QEMU's root folder,
make sure necessary tools and libraries are installed:
    sudo apt-get install make g++
    sudo apt-get install libfdt-dev libglib2.0-dev libpixman-1-dev zlib1g-dev
run configure script:
    ./configure
run multithreaded make:
    make -j8
run installation script:
    sudo make install

When building QEMU from source isn't necessary install a full binary package:
    sudo apt-get install qemu

To emulate future x86 targets (AVX-512) on modern x86 Linux hosts use Intel SDE:
    http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-software-development-emulator

In terminal window use "Emulate Everything Mode":
    path-to-kit/sde64 -knl -- /bin/bash
    path-to-kit/sde64 -skx -- /bin/bash
for AVX3.1 (Knights Landing) and AVX3.2 (Skylake Xeon) respectively.

To experiment with Linux in AArch64 mode on Raspberry Pi 3 consider:

1) Devuan Jessie 1.0.0 beta2 12-Oct-2016 (arm64 raspi3 image):
https://files.devuan.org/devuan_jessie_beta/embedded/
image boot credentials:
login: root
password: toor

2) openSUSE Leap42.2 or Tumbleweed 01-Feb-2017 (XFCE images):
https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:Raspberry_Pi3
image boot credentials:
login: root
password: linux

Flashing images above to an SD card is similar to a Raspbian installation:
http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md

Devuan image requires additional partition resizing steps after flashing:
http://elinux.org/RPi_Resize_Flash_Partitions (performed on host machine)
as well as installing XFCE once the image is booted (credentials above):
apt-get update
apt-get install xfce4
apt-get install make g++
startx

openSUSE image is RPM based (boots directly to XFCE, credentials above):
zypper in make gcc-c++

Adjust UniSIMD's makefiles to use g++ instead of triplet name, remove -static

Both images may require setting frequency scaling governor for best performance:
echo "ondemand" | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
Current frequency (600Mhz idle, 1200Mhz load) can be monitored using:
cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq   (tested with Devuan)
