v0.6: Unified SIMD Assembler, additional SIMD targets
  - rename SIMD target files to reflect SIMD width
  - enable SIMD instructions definitions only if RT_SIMD_CODE is defined
  - add new SIMD targets for SSE1, AVX1, AVX2 with corresponding build flags
  - add float-to-integer convert with explicit mode parameter (x86, AArch32)
  - add signed-integer-divide native instruction for ARM's AArch32 mode
  - add SIMD test for shifts by runtime value & BASE register, run level 16
  - add ver (cpuid) instruction for runtime SIMD target selection (x86 only)
  - add mmv (vmaskmov) to AVX backend for fast conditional loads/stores
  - add BASE instructions sub-tests to SIMD test if RT_BASE_TEST is defined
  - drop set-flags bit (slow) from BASE mul instructions on ARM
  - add RT_SIMD_FAST_FCTRL to save 1 instruction on FCTRL blocks entry
  - clarify current and future targets in rtarch (from here backported down)
  - add xor & neg BASE instructions to rtarch
  - add shifts by fixed BASE register instructions
  - add register versions of BASE mul/div, remainder instructions
  - add SIMD cvzps instruction for fp-to-int round-towards-zero conversion
  - add ASM_ENTER_F/ASM_LEAVE_F/ROUND*_F for non-IEEE flush-to-zero SIMD mode
  - add RT_SIMD_FLUSH_ZERO to enable faster non-IEEE flush-to-zero SIMD mode
  - add ASM_INIT/ASM_DONE to manage root info structure
  - make stack pointer register architecturally invisible
  - replace non-standard malloc.h with stdlib.h for malloc/free
  - clean up rtarch whitespace formatting

v0.5: Unified SIMD Assembler, API freeze for the engine
  - instructions naming scheme finalized
  - change ARM instructions to set flags
  - added framework for internal constants (used by reciprocals)
  - added SIMD instruction for cube root, reciprocal steps redesigned
  - additional SIMD tests, run level 15

v0.4: SIMD test framework, macro assembler overhaul
  - macro expansion reworked for better compiler compatibility
  - immediate/displacement parameters handling redesigned
  - added reciprocal support for SSE, MPE support refined

v0.3: SIMD test framework, run level 9
  - tests for integer mul, div, jmp instructions
  - SIMD tests for integer add, shl, shr instructions
  - SIMD tests for cvt, sqr, rsq instructions

v0.2: SIMD test framework, run level 5
  - SIMD tests for mul, div, cmp instructions

v0.1: SIMD test framework, run level 1
  - SIMD tests for add, sub instructions

v0.0: Empty project
  - initial file set and directory structure
