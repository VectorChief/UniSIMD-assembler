UniSIMD assembler is a high-level C/C++ macro assembler framework unified across
ARM, MIPS, Power and x86 architectures. It establishes a subset of both BASE and
SIMD instruction sets with clearly defined common API, so that application logic
can be written and maintained in one place without code replication.
The assembler itself isn't a separate tool, but rather a collection of C/C++
header files, which applications need to include directly in order to use.

At present, Intel SSE/SSE2/SSE4 and AVX/AVX2/AVX-512 (32/64-bit x86 ISAs),
ARMv7 NEON/NEONv2, ARMv8 AArch32 NEON and AArch64 NEON (32/64-bit ARM ISAs),
MIPS 32/64-bit r5/r6 MSA and Power 32/64-bit VMX/VSX (little/big-endian ISAs)
are mostly implemented, although scalar improvements, horizontal reductions,
wider SIMD vectors with zeroing/merging predicates in 3/4-operand instructions,
cross-precision fp-converters as well as sub-word (byte/half) integer SIMD ops
are planned as extensions to current 2/3-operand SPMD-driven vertical SIMD ISA.

The project comes with a test framework for Linux/GCC, Windows/VC++/TDM64-GCC.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.

UniSIMD core features:

 - High-level SIMD registers/ops as singles, pairs or quads
 - SIMD-aligned backend structures with offsets/factors
 - Vector-length agnostic vertical SIMD ISA, configurable
 - Simultaneous scalar+128/256-bit+configurable SIMD ops
 - ISA reservation for fp16/fp128 (half/quad) SIMD ops
 - C/C++, Compute, SPMD on 4 major archs
