UniSIMD assembler is a low-level macro assembler framework unified across
ARM and x86 architectures. It establishes a subset of both BASE and SIMD
instruction sets with clearly defined common API, so that application logic
can be written and maintained in one place without code replication.

At present, Intel SSE2/AVX2 (32-bit x86 ISA) and ARM NEON (32-bit ARMv7 ISA)
are three primary targets although wider SIMD, 64-bit addressing along with
more available registers and other architectures can be supported by design.
Preliminary naming scheme for potential future targets as well as extended
BASE and SIMD register files can be found in core/rtarch.h file.

The project comes with a test framework, which can be compiled in Linux/GCC,
Maemo/scratchbox (ARM version) as well as Windows/VC++ 6.0 or later.
The assembler itself isn't a separate tool, but rather a collection of C/C++
header files, which applications need to include directly in order to use.
Instructions for resolving dependencies and building the binaries
for supported platforms can be found in the accompanying INSTALL file.
